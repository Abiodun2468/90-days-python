# Project :
# create a program that takes users input for their name and age, then prints a greeting with their name and calculates the year they were born.

name = input("enter your name: ")  # string input
age = int(input("Enter your age : "))

# calculating the year of birth
current_year = 2025
birth_year = 2025 - age

print(f"Hello {name}, you were born in the year {year_of_birth}.")
